# 🌾 Predict Crop Production

This project is a machine learning-based web application that helps predict the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and climatic conditions. The model uses features like NPK values, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to provide recommendations for crop selection.

## 🔍 Features

- Predicts best crop to grow using trained ML model
- Flask-powered responsive web interface
- Inputs include soil nutrients, weather conditions, and more
- Visually appealing UI with glassmorphism design

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Flask  
- HTML/CSS  
- Git/GitHub  

## 📊 Model Input Features

- Nitrogen (N)  
- Phosphorus (P)  
- Potassium (K)  
- Temperature (°C)  
- Humidity (%)  
- pH value  
- Rainfall (mm)
